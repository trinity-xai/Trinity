For all external REST services that Trinity may utilize, it will search in the local services directory for configuration files for those services. By default Trinity looks for a "defaultRestAccessLayer.json" file using a static block prior to any calls.
This configuration object allows local users to customize base URLs and endpoints for various services.

A basic example of this looks like this:

{
  "messageType" : "RestAccessLayerConfig",
  "messageId" : 0,
  "baseRestURL" : "https://my.multimodal.model.org",
  "isAliveEndpoint" : "/embeddings/alive/",
  "imageEmbeddingsEndpoint" : "/embeddings/",
  "defaultImageModel" : "opensourceorg/embedding-model-name-version",
  
  "chatModelsEndpoint" : "/chat/models",
  "chatCompletionsEndpoint" : "/chat/completions",
  "defaultCaptionModel" : "opensourceorg/opensourcemodel-versionnumber-Vision-Instruct",
  
  "notes" : "My happy funtime model that I host"
} 

isAliveEndpoint and imageEmbeddingsEndpoint are keys that Trinity looks for to provide remote embedding vector support for images.
defaultImageModel is the name of the model that Trinity will request be used when requesting embeddings for images using the imageEmbeddingsEndpoint.

chatModelsEndpoint and chatCompletionEndpoint are keys that Trinity looks for to provide textual descriptions, captions and summaries for images and text blurbs.
defaultCaptionModel is the name of the model that Trinity will request be used when requesting completions for images/txt using the chatCompletionsEndpoint.


While this is a bit janky for now, it will improve as we expand the number of key named services. 

If you don't like it, make it better and submit a PR.
Yeah right... its not like anybody is even reading this let alone would actually lift a finger to help out with a PR.
