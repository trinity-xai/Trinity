/**
 * The Hyperbolic Tangent Kernel, also known as the
 * Sigmoid Kernel and as the Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
 * kernel, comes from the Neural Networks field, where
 * the bipolar sigmoid function is often used as an
 * activation function for artificial neurons.
 *
 * <p>It is interesting to note that a SVM model using a
 * sigmoid kernel function is equivalent to a two-layer,
 * perceptron neural network. This kernel was quite popular
 * for support vector machines due to its origin from neural
 * network theory. Also, despite being only conditionally
 * positive definite, it has been found to perform well
 * in practice.
