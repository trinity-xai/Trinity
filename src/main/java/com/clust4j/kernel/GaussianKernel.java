/**
 * The Gaussian kernel is an example of radial basis function kernel:
 *
 * <p><code>k(x,y) = exp(-||x-y||<sup>2</sup>/2*sigma<sup>2</sup>)</code></p>
 * <p>
 * The adjustable parameter sigma plays a major role in the performance of the kernel,
 * and should be carefully tuned to the problem at hand. If overestimated, the exponential
 * will behave almost linearly and the higher-dimensional projection will start to lose
 * its non-linear power. In the other hand, if underestimated, the function will lack
 * regularization and the decision boundary will be highly sensitive to noise in training data.
