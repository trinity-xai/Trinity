### Trinity

**Visualization tool for hyperdimensional data.**

Trinity provides a 3D scatter plot with automatic 2D
projections of feature/factor data typically derived
from neural inspired systems such as deep learning
neural networks and biological neuronal firings. The
primary visual view is through its _Hyperspace_ view
which presents a 3D scatter plot of the current
hyperdimensions and allows the user to instantly
shift, slide or select which indices within the
hyperspace to use for the scatterplot. The 2D
permutations of 3D view are automatically projected
as 2D plots within the same view on to the sides of
a 3D plotting cube.

The 3D scene is interactive. The user can pan,
rotate and zoom either the 3D camera or the points
themselves. The scatter points are interactive
allowing the user to select individual points to
bring up the associated data/imagery with that
feature. Help documentation is provided as a PDF
that is packaged with the source.
